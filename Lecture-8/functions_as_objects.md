##  Functions in pythons as objects


## What happens when you call a function?

A function call creates an environment that runs the body of the function that it is calling and that environment disappears after it returns a value. This environment exists separate from the main program environment.

## First class functions 
First class functions are functions that can be passed into other functions known as higher order functions. 
Functions just like any other value can be passed into other functions as arguments or passed as values of variables. They can also be returned as values.


## Functions as arguments

Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as their argument. This happens when you create reusable functions that you want to run as a piece of work inside these higher order functions as seen in the `is_even.py` file
